Authors: LI, AO, HA

# Introduction
An influx of smart technologies on the market has allowed our televisions, doorbells, coffee machines, and other everyday objects to be connected to the internet, making it possible for us to access them from  anywhere  in  the  world.  However,  these  devices  are  often  designed  with  convenience  and affordability  in  mind,  and  not  security.  So,  if  we  can  control  our  devices,  who  else  can?  The  recent highly  publicized  hacks  on  Ring  smart  doorbells,  Nest  cameras, and  the  Tesla  Model  S  have shown the   dangers   of   usingthese   technologies   before   understanding   their   vulnerabilities.   Yet,   the integration  of  IoT  devices  is  only  exploding,  with  an estimated  10  billion  devices  now  being  in  use worldwide and estimates reaching at least 22 billion by 2025.In  this  document,  weidentify  best  practices for  buying,  setting  up,  and  maintaining IoT  devices in home and business environments.
