## Introduction
An influx of smart technologies on the market has allowed our televisions, doorbells, coffee machines, and other everyday objects to be connected to the internet, making it possible for us to access them from anywhere in the world. However, these devices are often designed with convenience and affordability in mind, and not security. So,  if we can control our devices, who else can? The recent highly publicized hacks on Ring smart doorbells, Nest cameras, and the Tesla Model S have shown the dangers of using these technologies before understanding their vulnerabilities. Yet, the integration of IoT devices is only exploding, with an estimated 10 billion devices now being in use worldwide and estimates reaching at least 22 billion by 2025. In this document, we identify best practices for buying, setting up, and maintaining IoT  devices in home and business environments.

## What to Consider When Choosing a Device
**General**
*Research the brand.* Valuable information can be gained by determining which company owns the brand, its reputation, whether the hardware is proprietary or rebranded, and what any related publications state. These pieces give a picture of the brand’s stance on security and privacy, and hence its trustworthiness. Does the company’s website say anything about its commitment to security and privacy? How easy is it to find this information?  Furthermore, devices built in countries known to have more security controversies or lax privacy laws are riskier from a consumer standpoint.

     Example: ioXt Alliance: Get ioXt Certified
     The ioXt Certification Program is one example of a certification granted after vetting the security of various IoT devices according to the standards 
     set out by the ioXt Alliance, a group of technology organizations committed to improving IoT security. Having its products certified indicates that a 
     company incorporates security practices into product design, and not just as an afterthought or not at all.
