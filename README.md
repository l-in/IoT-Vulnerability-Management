# IoT-Vulnerability-Management: Best Practices for Installing Security Cameras/IoT Devices
Authors: LI, AO, HA

## Introduction
An influx of smart technologies on the market has allowed our televisions, doorbells, coffee machines, and other everyday objects to be connected to the internet, making it possible for us to access them from anywhere in the world. However, these devices are often designed with convenience and affordability in mind, and not security. So,  if we can control our devices, who else can? The recent highly publicized hacks on Ring smart doorbells, Nest cameras, and the Tesla Model S have shown the dangers of using these technologies before understanding their vulnerabilities. Yet, the integration of IoT devices is only exploding, with an estimated 10 billion devices now being in use worldwide and estimates reaching at least 22 billion by 2025. In this document, we identify best practices for buying, setting up, and maintaining IoT  devices in home and business environments.

## What to Consider When Choosing a Device
**General**

*Research the brand.* Valuable information can be gained by determining which company owns the brand, its reputation, whether the hardware is proprietary or rebranded, and what any related publications state. These pieces give a picture of the brand’s stance on security and privacy, and hence its trustworthiness. Does the company’s website say anything about its commitment to security and privacy? How easy is it to find this information?  Furthermore, devices built in countries known to have more security controversies or lax privacy laws are riskier from a consumer standpoint.

     Example: ioXt Alliance: Get ioXt Certified
     The ioXt Certification Program is one example of a certification granted after vetting the security of various IoT devices 
     according to the standards set out by the ioXt Alliance, a group of technology organizations committed to improving IoT 
     security. Having its products certified indicates that a company incorporates security practices into product design, 
     and not just as an afterthought or not at all.

*You get what you pay for.* Cheaper upfront costs mean that the company either spends less money securing its devices, or it covers the costs elsewhere by selling your data.

*Avoid “plug and play” setups.* You do not have control over how the camera is configured in your network when it is done automatically by the camera. Networks and their configurations are never one-size-fits-all, so do not use a camera with a one-size-fits-all automatic setup!

**Encryption**

*Choose a camera that uses an encrypted connection with its server. This is indicated by an HTTPS (not HTTP) connection.* HTTPS indicates that data is encrypted before being sent across the internet between the camera and the web server. Encryption is necessary because if any sensitive information (like login credentials or network configuration details) present on your network is intercepted by an adversary, it is unreadable. When information cannot be deciphered, it is more difficult for an adversary to use it to gain access.

*If possible, select a camera that uses a modern type of encryption to protect data in storage and in transit, like AES, TwoFish, Blowfish, or ChaCha 20.* While HTTPS does indicate that data is encrypted, the type of encryption matters because some methods of encryption, like DES, are outdated and easier to crack than others. Weak encryption does not protect sensitive data well enough to be used in modern networks.

**Maintenance/Updates**

*Choose a camera that receives updates and patches on a regular basis.* Such information may be specified on the manufacturer’s page. Updates are critical because they fix vulnerabilities that can be used to exploit devices. Furthermore, if the device has a corresponding app, ensure that the app receives regular updates as well before downloading it. If there is no mention of firmware updates, then it is likely that updates are rarely or never made. Another important note is to steer clear of cameras that require manual updates. This is easy to forget or execute unsuccessfully and shows a lack of commitment from the company to maintaining its products.

     Example: Wired: Critical Flaws in Millions of IoT Devices May Never Get Fixed
     Amnesia:33 is a collection of vulnerabilities existing in seven different open source TCP/IP stacks used to connect 
     barcode readers, building automation systems, industrial control equipment, and other IoT devices to the internet. 
     It affects millions of devices spanning at least 150 different vendors. The software, being open source, can hence 
     be repurposed in whichever way is necessary for any device in question, and the modifications and lack of governing 
     body to release updates and patches means that these vulnerabilities, which have been in circulation for nearly 20 
     years, persist.

*If possible, select cameras that have fewer points of entry (i.e., apps, online interfaces, etc.).* To have a reliable camera ecosystem, all points of entry must be secured. Having more points of entry gives an attacker more opportunities to potentially enter your network. Plus, it requires more work for developers to maintain, which drives up the cost; hence, cheap cameras could indicate substandard software development. To reduce the possibility of hacking, select a camera that has as few points of entry as possible. In most cases, having both an app and an online interface is unnecessary.

## Setting Up a Device
**General**

*Be wary of addon services like cloud storage or facial recognition.* While convenient, by enabling these services, you are consenting to your video footage and other extracted data being stored in servers unknown to you and chosen by the company, where it may be collected for other purposes and sold to or shared with other vendors.  

*Carefully consider what is within the video and audio recording range of the device’s location.* For privacy and confidentiality reasons, ensure that the camera is only recording footage that should be recorded, and nothing more.

**Passwords**

*Change the default password upon setting up the camera.* If the camera comes with a default password, change it to a unique password. Default passwords are easy to guess. Furthermore, lists of passwords from compromised devices and accounts (including default passwords) are available over the internet, so all an adversary needs to do to gain access is cycle through the list until a match is found.

     Example: CSO: The Mirai botnet explained: How teen scammers and CCTV cameras almost brought down the internet
     In October 2016, the Mirai Botnet, a network of between 200,000 and 300,000 hijacked IoT devices, unleashed a DDoS 
     attack on Dyn, an American tech company partly responsible for holding up most of the internet in the United States. 
     The attack took down the internet on the entire east coast. The botnet was built by scanning the internet for 
     accessible devices and then attempting to log into them using a list of commonly used default username and password 
     combinations. Because default passwords are rarely changed, this allowed them to be infected and controlled from afar.

*Do not use a password that has already been involved in a data breach.* Compromised passwords are readily available on the internet. These files are used first in brute force attacks, so it is easy to break in.

*If it is available, enable Multi Factor Authentication when setting up your login credentials.* In case an adversary finds out your password, multi factor authentication adds another layer of necessary authentication that would, in most cases, prevent the attack from progressing.

**Maintenance/Updates**

*Check whether your router supports separate, secure networks.* Isolating your camera from the rest of your home/business network(s) reduces the chances of intrusions into your other devices in case the camera gets hacked.

     Example: The Hacker News: Casino Gets Hacked Through Its Internet-Connected Fish Tank Thermometer
     A London casino had its gamblers database stolen through its fish tank thermometer. Hackers found the unsecured thermometer 
     connected to the internet and used it to enter the casino’s network. They found the database containing the personal and 
     financial information of all the patrons and got their hands on it by extracting it through the thermometer. Isolating 
     the thermometer on a separate network would have made this hack much harder to execute!

*(For businesses) Ensure that your IT team configures a robust firewall.* A firewall should restrict access to the device to as few individuals, machines, and/or IP addresses as possible. A restrictive firewall would prevent adversaries from connecting to the device before carrying out an attack.

*(For businesses) Ensure that your IT team maintains an intrusion detection system for IoT devices.* An intrusion detection system monitors device access and creates notifications of abnormal behaviour and possible attacks which can be further investigated by administrators.

## Afterword
While these tips provide a solid foundation to work from in developing your secure IoT ecosystem, keep in mind that the world of IoT is constantly changing. What is secure now can change at any moment, and as such it is important to think carefully about integrating such devices into your networks. Like any other technology, carefully consider the risks you may expose yourself to if these devices were to malfunction or be attacked. If the risk is too high, consider researching devices that have similar function, but do not need to be connected to the internet.
